> **Creating modern applications using Jakarta EE technology**

## Overview
This study examines possibilities of Jakarta EE technology to creating modern applications based on microservice architecture. The technical part of the thesis involved creating a web application for music bands to sell tickets for their concerts individually. What is more, users can also post comments and like specific events. The application was implemented using Jakarta EE platform with MicroProfile project. It is based on microservices hosted in Docker containers. The project was split into two naturally divided parts: *frontend* and *backend*. The first one is responsible for a customer service management, api gateway and user interface. The second one contains three independent systems providing implementation of business logic.
